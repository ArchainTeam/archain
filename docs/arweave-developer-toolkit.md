# Arweave App Developer Toolkit API

## Introduction

This file provides an introduction to building applications on top of **Arweave**. Two primary APIs exist for interacting with **Arweave** - Erlang callbacks and an HTTP interface. You can find the files that implement these at `adt_simple` and `ar_http_iface`.

To get started building **Arweave** ADT applications please clone this repository and consider checking out the sample applications found in `src/apps`. These sample applications provided a guide through the development of a number of simple Arweave applications, from a basic monitoring app, to a de-centralised microblogging service.

## Via Erlang

`adt_simple` provides an easy to use abstraction for building **Arweave** apps in Erlang. The module provides a simple method (using a callback module) for interacting with the **Arweave**.

All callback functions in the modules that use this system are optional. Unimplemented callbacks will be ignored.

Supported events and callbacks:

```
new_transaction             Processes a new transaction that has been
                            submitted to the weave.
confirmed_transaction       Processes new transactions that have been
                            accepted onto a block.
new_block                   Processes a new block that has been added
                            to the weave.
message                     Called when non-gossip messages are received
                            by the server.
```

Each callback can take two optional arguments: the gossip server state and an arbitrary application state term. The required inputs and outputs of these functions are defined in the following way:

```
callback(NewData) -> _
callback(AppState, NewData) -> NewAppState
callback(AppState, GossipState, NewData) -> {NewAppState, GossipState}
```

## Via HTTP interface

Each node in the network runs an HTTP server that can be interacted with via
HTTP requests. The HTTP API exposes the following endpoints:

```
GET /block/hash/[hash_id]     Returns a block by hash.  
GET /block/height/[height]    Returns a block by block height.
POST /block                   Adds a block passed in body.
POST /tx                      Adds a transaction passed in body.
```

For example a GET request to http://192.168.0.0:1984/block/height where the body of the GET request is the block height will return that block in the form of a JSON object.

Similarly, you can use POST to send transactions and blocks to be added and use GET requests to to obtain peers, get a block by its height, hash or or simply obtain information about it. In this way, it is possible to perform many actions on the Arweave purely via platform agnostic HTTP.

Information (transactions, blocks) is always passed in the body of requests in a JSON object format.
